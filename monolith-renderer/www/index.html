    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The map displays how Minecraft versions inf-20100611 to a1.1.2_01 generated terrain. Blue and green areas correspond <i>roughly</i> to water and land. Monoliths are displayed in bright red.
    </p>
    <h2>Theory</h2>
    <p>
      Monoliths generate if the 2-dimensional 10-octave <b>hill-noise</b> (idk
      how other people call that one) takes on values below -512 and the 2d
      16-octave terrain noise's absolute value is greater or equal 8000. The hill-noise is processed into a <b>hillFactor</b>, which is used in the formula
      <code>(noiseY - processedDepthNoise) * 12.0 / hillFactor</code>, which is
      usually responsible for making lower Y levels more likely to be solid than
      higher ones (influenced of course by variations in the noise to cause
      mountains and such). If this <code>hillFactor</code> is barely above 0,
      then the terrain exactly follows the depth noise without any floaty bits
      (which are caused by 3-d elements).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if the <code>hillFactor</code> is below 0, then this formula is
      effectively negated. Lower Y levels are now more likely to be air and
      higher ones are more likely to be solid. The edge of solid/air is still at
      the Y-level determined by <code>processedDepthNoise</code>, the sides have
      just flipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is technically possible for an area with negative
      <code>hillFactor</code> to not appear as a monolith, because the absolute
      value of <code>hillFactor</code> is so large that it can be overpowered by
      interpolation noise. This is very unlikely and affected areas would likely be surrounded by "normal" monoliths.
    </p>

    <h2>Tech</h2>
    <p>
      The map is calculated in Rust, by applying octaves of noise until it's
      known which color to use. Most pixels are nowhere close to being a
      monolith, so they can be discarded after applying just a few octaves. The
      code was compiled to WebAssembly and is running in a few WebWorkers,
      meaning that the calculation is quick and takes advantage of multiple
      cores. The rendered images are then displayed using Leaflet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webpack is doing a whole load of stuff here that I don't properly
      understand (and would prefer didn't exist), but the template used it, so
      it's here.
